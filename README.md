Aim:
To understand and implement the basic structure of a C++ program with a focus on different data types.

Software Required:
Visual Studio

Theory:
In C++, data types define the kind of data a variable can store and determine the amount of memory allocated for that variable. Each data type has a specific size and range. Choosing the correct data type is crucial for efficient memory usage and accurate data handling.

Character Data Type (char):
Used to store a single character. Declared using the char keyword. It occupies 1 byte of memory and stores characters within single quotes (e.g., 'A'). Characters are stored using ASCII values, allowing storage of up to 256 characters.

Integer Data Type (int):
Used to store whole numbers. Declared using the int keyword. On 64-bit systems, it takes up 4 bytes and supports values ranging from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. It can represent values in binary, octal, decimal, and hexadecimal formats.

Boolean Data Type (bool):
Stores logical values: true (1) or false (0). Declared using the bool keyword and takes up 1 byte of memory.

Floating Point Data Type (float):
Used for storing decimal numbers with single precision. Declared with the float keyword. It uses 4 bytes of memory and supports a range from 1.2e-38 to 3.4e+38.

Double Data Type (double):
Stores decimal numbers with double precision. Declared using the double keyword. It occupies 8 bytes and supports a much larger range: from 1.7e-308 to 1.7e+308.

Implementation:
In the program, the user is prompted to input values for various data types. The program then displays the type and size of each data type.

To run the program, simply copy the code into Visual Studio and execute it.

Conclusion:
Through this practical, I explored and understood the different data types available in C++, their memory allocation, and how to use them effectively in a program.
